Title: EEG data investigating neural correlates of music-induced emotion.

Description: This dataset accompanies the publication by Daly et al. (2018) and has been analysed in Daly et al. (2014; 2015a; 2015b) (please see Section 5 for full references). The purpose of the research activity in which the data were collected was to investigate the EEG neural correlates of music-induced emotion. For this purpose 31 healthy adult participants listened to 40 music clips of 12 s duration each, targeting a range of emotional states. The music clips comprised excerpts from film scores spanning a range of styles and rated on induced emotion. 
The dataset contains unprocessed EEG data from all 31 participants (age range 18-66, 18 female) while listening to the music clips, together with the reported induced emotional responses . The paradigm involved 6 runs of EEG recordings. The first and last runs were resting state runs, during which participants were instructed to sit still and rest for 300 s. The other 4 runs each contained 10 music listening trials.

BIDS File listing:
The dataset comprises data from 31 participants, named using the convention:
sub_s_number
where: s_number is a random participant number from 1 to 31. For example: ‘sub-08’ contains data obtained from participant 8. 

The data is BIDS format and contains EEG and associated meta data. The sampling rate is 1 kHz and the EEG corresponding to a music clip is 20 s long (the duration of the clips).

Each data folder contains the following data (please note that the number of runs varies between participants):
